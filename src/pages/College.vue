    <Text
      >The Vila Hortali√ßa project grew from a university-based social
      entrepreneurship initiative guided by Professor Sibeli P. Ferronato. Aimed
      at giving students proactive and meaningful entrepreneurial experience
      while engaging with a local community lacking access to basic resources,
      the project involved three initiatives approved by the community: one
      focused on children, another on workforce integration, and a third on
      domestic gardening, which is the focus here. Vila Hortali√ßa was created to
      help the Vila Usina community achieve self-sustainability and access
      healthier food, while also fostering entrepreneurial spirit within the
      community. The project brought together students from Production
      Engineering (Kauterine Dallanol, Pedro, Elton Maciel, and Matheus
      Gandolfo) and Information Systems (Lucas Gois and myself, Laura Vivan),
      combining diverse perspectives and creative approaches. The July 3rd
      activity was planned throughout the semester using tools like CANVAS,
      ensuring that classroom learning and careful project planning contributed
      to its successful implementation.</Text
