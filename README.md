üêãA work in progress

## Description

This is a portfolio project, so basically is inteended to showcase my web development projects. It's Notion-inspired theme and built using Vue.js3. Also, it has a SPA (Single-page-application) approach, which means that this frontend project is being fully controlled by Vue.js.
